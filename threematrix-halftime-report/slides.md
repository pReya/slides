### Bad news: Business models
- Threema is a swiss private company that wants to earn money
- Two ways to approach a bridge solution:
  - Use an existing, paid API product offered by Threema (👈 we've tried this until now – but it doesn't work)
  - "Fake" client application from reverse engineered OSS mobile App (🥈 we will try this now, but there is a risk, Threema won't like this approach)
